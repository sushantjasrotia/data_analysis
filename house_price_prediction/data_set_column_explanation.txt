Column Explanations

1. Id –
    Just a unique number for each house (used to count or identify records).

2- MSSubClass (Building Class) –
    Tells what type of dwelling it is (e.g., 20 = 1-story single-family home, 30 = 1-story duplex, etc.). Basically the category of the house style.

3- MSZoning (Zoning Classification) –
    The general zoning for the property, like:

        RL = Residential Low Density (normal single-family homes)

        RM = Residential Medium Density

        C (all) = Commercial

        FV = Floating Village Residential

        RH = Residential High Density

        This affects what kind of buildings can exist in that area.

4- LotArea –
    The size of the lot (the land on which the house sits), measured in square feet. Bigger lots usually mean more expensive houses.

5- LotConfig –
    How the lot is situated. For example:

        Inside lot (normal, surrounded by other houses)

        Corner lot

        Cul-de-sac (dead end street)

        Frontage on multiple streets

6- BldgType –
    The type of building:

        1Fam = Single-family detached house

        2fmCon = Two-family conversion

        Duplex = Two-family home

        Twnhs = Townhouse

        TwnhsE = Townhouse end unit

7- OverallCond (Overall Condition) –
    A rating (1–10) of the house’s overall condition (not quality, but condition).

        1 = Very Poor

        5 = Average

        10 = Excellent

8- YearBuilt –
    The year the house was originally constructed.

10- Exterior1st –
     The material covering the outside of the house (like siding, brick, wood, stucco, etc.).

11- BsmtFinSF2 –
     The finished square footage of the second type of basement (sometimes basements are split into different sections). If the house doesn’t have that, it’s usually 0.

12- TotalBsmtSF –
     The total size of the basement (finished + unfinished), in square feet.

13- SalePrice –
      The price the house was sold for (this is the target variable in prediction tasks).
